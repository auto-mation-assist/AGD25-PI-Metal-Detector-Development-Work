# AGD25-PI-Metal-Detector-Development-Work
Portions of this project use circuitry protected US Patent No.: 10,181,720 B1,
"Dual polarity high voltage blocking circuit for a pulse induction metal detector", by
inventor David Emery. It is the responsibility of the person using the information provided here
to insure that patent rights of that patent are not violated.

Qspice simulations that were created for design work of my AGD25.1 DIY Metal Detector
can be found here along with proposed and as built circuit diagrams. This project is in the
early stages of design work and sections added as soon as each stage is designed an
simulation run.

This is not a project for those who like low parts counts.
